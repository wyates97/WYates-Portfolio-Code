           <h2 class='summaryHeader'><b>Professional</b> Summary</h2>
           <p>In my freshman year of college I created created my own graphic design brand, @DubsEdits which was used to create graphics for upcoming local athletes in Ohio. Various schools and sports design teams began reaching out to connect with me following my growth on social media. Which gave me the opportunity to work with Beach City Hoops (California videography team), Middle Brooks Academy (LA), Cathedral Prep (LA), Malone University (Canton, OH), Kent State University (Kent, OH), and Push Sports Group / Kingdom Summer League (Columbus, OH). Following these experiences I've recently begun rebranding to @TheOfficialViz in order to allow my social media fan base to grow in areas other than sports.</p>
           <p>While in school I focused my studies on human interactions with technology whether its web design, user experience design, graphic design, usability, or project management. I've also began adding more projects to my web design portfolio to give potential clients and workplaces a look at my skill set. Please refer to the links in my "Work Experience" section below to visit these sites. Working as a freelancer and through college courses I have developed strong management skills like digital communication, personal scheduling, and accountability. I am looking to gain more professional team skills, throughout my summary I haven't experienced much work in group settings besides numerous group projects in the classroom. I can be as professional and versatile as needed for any opportunity that finds my skillsets useful to their workplace. I am currently pursuing  job opportunities as a Front End Web Developer, UX/UI Designer, and any other Web Designer related fields.</p>
